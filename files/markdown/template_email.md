Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am very pleased to apply to the position of <!-- FILL NAME of Position -->Assistant Professor <!-- FILL NAME of Position -->at the at Swedish Institute for Social Research. <!-- End -->

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Paris School of Economics and Turin University. My research is focused in labor economics, development economics and personnel economics. I expect to complete my degree in May 2020. My research aims to understand how labor markets function, both from a theoretical and an applied perspective. My research aims to explain the process behind the matching function. To do so, I have highlighted the necessity to consider multiple and heterogeneous skills. This approach allows us to comprehend a wide range of labor market outcomes in a more granular way. In support of my application I have attached the following materials:


- My [curriculum vitae](https://www.jaimemmontana.com/files/JM_short_CV.pdf).
- My job market paper: [Job posting and multidimensional skills mismatch](https://www.jaimemmontana.com/files/PDF/JMP_J.MONTANA%282020%29_last.pdf).
- My [Research Statement](https://www.jaimemmontana.com/files/PDF/JMONTANA_Research_statement[2020].pdf), in which I summarise my short and long term agenda.
- My [Teaching Statement](https://www.jaimemmontana.com/files/PDF/JMONTANA_Teaching_Statement[2020].pdf), summarising my teaching philosophy and where you can find my teaching orientation.
